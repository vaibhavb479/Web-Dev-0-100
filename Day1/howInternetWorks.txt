Title: How the Internet Works - For Beginners!

Key Points:

1. The internet is a global network of interconnected computers and devices, not located in a single place. It is a "web of wires" spread across the world.

2. When you type something on Google, your device (client) is connected to your home Wi-Fi, which is connected to the internet through physical wires/cables.

3. The device sends a "packet" containing the information you typed (e.g.[6] "India") to the DNS (Domain Name System) server. The DNS server translates the domain name (Google.com) into the corresponding IP address.

4. The packet is then routed through a network of routers, which direct the packet to the correct destination (the Google servers) based on the IP address.

5. The Google servers receive the packet, process the request (search for "India"), and send the search results back to the client device.

6. The packet travels back through the network of routers to reach the client device, which then displays the search results.

7. This entire process of sending a request, routing it, and receiving the response is how the internet works to enable web browsing and online services.
